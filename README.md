## Collection of my solutions for exercises in Kernighan/Ritchie The C Programming language

I have the german edition of 

Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie: Programmieren in C. 2.Ausgabe ANSI C.
1990 Carl Hanser Verlag MÃ¼nchen, Wien
ISBN 3-446-25497-3

And while I continue to solve the exercises, I think, that it is a good
idea to share my solutions. Perhaps somebody has better solutions.

My coding style differs a little bit from the books. 
It is more a Microsoft coding style that I like because one sees at the 
curly brackets very good where a block begins and where it ends. 
I try to use this style through all my solutions.

I want to emphasize that it are my solutions and tries and 
in no way authoritive.

In order to compile my an exercise, I am using the GNU compiler on
my linux and I use make.

It is only needed to give the command

make ex1_4 

for example, to compile the program ex1_4.c
.
